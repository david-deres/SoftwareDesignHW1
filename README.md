## Notes

### Implementation Summary
Short summary of your implementation, including data structures used, design choices made, and
a short tour of the class hierarchy you created.

### Testing Summary
Short summary describing the ways you chose to test your code.

- Unit tests for the primitive storage stub we created, in order to assure the reliability of the lowest layer.
    - in those tests we've checked that the assumptions given to us in the assignment really hold (like persistence) 
- Unit tests for the SifriTaub App - first, all the trivial tests in order to check that our methods work properly.
Next, we thought on corner cases and also used questions asked in Piazza to test that our code covers those cases as well.

### Difficulties
Please list any technological difficulties you had while working on this assignment, especially
with the tools used: Kotlin, JUnit, MockK, Guice, and Gradle.

- It took time to understand how to properly use the modules with Guice.
